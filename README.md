# Projeto Nies-Solar
#### It's a web development project with the objective of improving my web development skills.
#### Bad code practices may happen as this is my first web project.

## About
This project is a full-stack web user/admin interface developed with front-end made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and with back-end made in PostgreSQL and NodeJS. It was built for a firm that sells solar energy to costumers via third party. The main purpose of the project is to provide a interface for the costumer of the firm to consult his montly energy bill, and provide some comparations between his energy bill and what it would be without buying it from the company. Also, the admin interface provides some easy management tools to add/delete users and check the user data. (Some of the features may not been implemented yet).

The project may be commented in english and some times in portuguese, sorry for that, and there could be some typos as english is not my native language.

## ToDo's
The project isn't complete yet. Here are the main things to do:
Make real interfaces (For now, almost everything is just test fields, not the actual final page).
Create the user dashboard system that gathers their eletric bill (This one does not depend on me entirely, as I'm still not aware of how the data is extracted, but it should be fine to write some NodeJS or python script for that)
Use Cloud Database (For now, the database and server is my Personal Computer)
